<h1>Blackjack Game</h1>
<p>This is a simple Blackjack game created with Python. The game is played against a dealer and the goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over. The game starts with two cards for the player and two cards for the dealer. The player can then choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer then reveals their second card and must hit until they reach 17 or higher. The game ends when either the player or the dealer goes over 21 points or when both players stand and the scores are compared.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can download the code files from the repository and launch the game from your terminal or IDE by running main.py</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>When you run the Blackjack game, you will be dealt two cards. Each card has a point value based on its rank, with face cards being worth 10 points and aces being worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is better for the player's hand. The player can then choose to hit and receive another card, or stand and keep their current hand.</p>
<p>After the player has finished their turn, the dealer reveals their second card and must hit until they reach 17 or higher. If the dealer busts (goes over 21 points), the player wins. Otherwise, the scores of the player and dealer are compared and the highest score without going over 21 wins. In the case of a tie, the game is declared a push and the player's bet is returned.</p>

<h3>Additional Rules and Features</h3>
<p>In addition to the basic rules outlined above, there are several additional rules and features that can be implemented to make the game more interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Splitting:</b> If the player is dealt two cards of the same rank (such as two 5s), they can choose to split their hand into two separate hands and play each one individually. This requires the player to place a second bet equal to their initial bet.</li>
<li><b>Insurance:</b> If the dealer's first card is an ace, the player can choose to place an additional bet equal to half of their initial bet as insurance. If the dealer's second card is a 10-point card, the player's insurance bet pays out 2:1. This protects the player from losing their entire bet if the dealer has a blackjack.</li>
<li><b>Double Down:</b> After receiving their initial two cards, the player can choose to double their bet and receive only one additional card. This can be useful if the player has a strong hand and believes that one more card will give them the best chance of winning.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Have fun playing Blackjack!</p>
